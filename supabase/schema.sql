-- The `stripe` schema below is provisioned and owned by an external Stripe
-- sync tool (customers/charges/subscriptions/etc. tables), not by this repo,
-- so it is not represented here in full. These two trigger functions are
-- tracked in this file only because the Supabase Security Advisor flagged
-- them for a mutable search_path, and fixing that requires a full
-- CREATE OR REPLACE. Logic is unchanged from what is live in the database —
-- only `SET search_path = ''` was added. Neither function body references
-- any table or schema-qualified object (only pg_catalog builtins:
-- jsonb_populate_record, jsonb_build_object, now()), which are always
-- resolved regardless of search_path, so no qualification was needed.
